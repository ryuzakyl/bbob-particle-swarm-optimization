# bbob-particle-swarm-optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) implementation. Benchmarks are based on the Python version of the COCO experimental framework and the post-processing tool.

## Implementation details
The code was conceived for Python2.x series. The implementation is based on the section dedicated to PSO in the book ``Essentials of Metaheuristics`` (page 53).

## COCO tool documentation
